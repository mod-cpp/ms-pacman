# Exercise: Hello {fmt} on Godbolt

## Background: {fmt}

"{fmt} is an open-source formatting library providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams."
[From the {fmt} GitHub page](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

In C++20 we are getting parts of this functionality in [std::format](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format).

In C++23 we might get `std::print`.

## Exercise

1. Play with Hello World on [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/8oxsGG8WM)
