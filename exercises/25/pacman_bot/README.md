# Exercise: PacMan Bot

## Background:

PacMan can be controlled with the keyboard, but those inputs can be automated. The only thing that needs to change is
the value within the InputState class.

Start by giving InputState random values on each update and then program in a fixed set of movement. For example "Go
Right for 3 seconds, then down, right, up, right". This should pickup the first super pellet.

In this exercise, the input code in processEvents is not needed.
